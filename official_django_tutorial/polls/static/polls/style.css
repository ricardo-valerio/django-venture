        polls/static/polls/style.css

Because of how the AppDirectoriesFinder staticfile finder works, you can refer
to this static file in Django simply as polls/style.css, similar to how you
reference the path for templates.

Just like templates, we might be able to get away with putting our static
files directly in polls/static (rather than creating another
polls subdirectory), but it would actually be a bad idea.
Django will choose the first static file it finds whose name matches,
and if you had a static file with the same name in a different application,
Django would be unable to distinguish between them.
We need to be able to point Django at the right one, and the easiest way to
ensure this is by namespacing them. That is, by putting those static files
inside another directory named for the application itself.
